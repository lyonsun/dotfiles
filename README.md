# My configuration files for various tools

This repo contains my configuration files for various tools, by using chezmoi as the dotfiles manager.

## chezmoi

chezmoi is a user-friendly tool that simplifies managing your dotfiles. Learn more about how it works on GitHub [here](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

## nvim

I started to use [neovim](https://neovim.io) with [lazyvim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) as my editor from late 2024. Before I used mostly Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code.

## aerospace

I moved from [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) to [AeroSpace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) for window management.

## wezterm

[Wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) is my goto terminal nowadays, I have been always using iTerm since 2013, I then got to know and stuck with Warp since 2022.
